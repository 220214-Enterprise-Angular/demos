# Agile
## Background
![agile diagram](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*33LCecIS5Y0p9soE.png)

In the 1990s, a small group of thought leaders got together and developed a new philosophy called Agile.

In 2001, this group published to the web what is known as the **agile manifesto**. This is when Agile really started to be formalized as a philosophy that is now prevalent across organizations.

Agile is the process of **iterative development**. This means we pass through the SDLC multiple times (infinite number of times even).

This enables
- Feedback
- Response to change

Instead of delivering a product all at once, the product is released incrementally via each iteration.

# Agile Manifesto 4 Core Values
- **Individuals And Interactions** over processes and tools
    - Processes and tools can be important, but individuals and interactions are MORE important
- **Working Software** over comprehensive documentation
    - Documentation can be very important
    - But, ultimately having working software is more important
- **Customer Collaboration** over contract negotation
    - Financial transactions with a customer and negotiating with them is important
    - But collaborating with the customer, receiving feedback, etc. is more important
- **Responding To Change** over following a plan
    - Plans are important
    - But responding to change is more important

# Agile Manifesto 12 Principles
From the 4 core values, we can derive the 12 principles of Agile software.

1. The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and **continuous delivery** of valuable software
2. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
3. Working software is the primary measure of progress
4. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
5. Business people and developers MUST work together daily throughout the project
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation
7. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
8. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
9. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts their behavior accordingly
10. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
11. Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work NOT done, is essential
12. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage

# Agile Methodologies / Frameworks
Agile is a philosophy. It does not highlight specific processes to actually be Agile. Agile frameworks such as the ones listed below are actual implementations of the Agile philosophy

- Scrum
- Kanban
- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Scrumban = Scrum + Kanban

Most organizations will often be utilizing Scrum. In project 2 + 3, we will be trying to adhere to Scrum

- Project 2 (group project)
- Project 3 (cohort project)
