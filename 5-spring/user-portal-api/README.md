- run `docker compose up` > this will run 3 containers: 

  1. The Spring Boot app will be running at `http://localhost:5000/api`
  2. Prometheus will collect data from Spring Boot Actuator via Micrometer and is running at `http://localhost:9090`
  3. The metrics generated by Prometheus on port 9090 is fed to Grafana running at `http://localhost:3000`
