The waterfall model was described by Winston Royce in 1970 as an example of what not to do.
- Waterfall was written about in 1970
- It was not called waterfall until much later
- Winston was of the opinion that software development should have an allowance for the repetition of phases
    - This is the opposite of waterfall
    - He preferred **iterative models**

# Waterfall Characteristics
- Waterfall is broken up into 7 different phases
    - These are the phases highlighted in the SDLC
- Progress goes "down" in one direction
- Once you progress to the next phase, there is no going back to a previous phase

# Pros and Cons
Pros
- Waterfall is a plan driven model, which makes it easier for project managers to deal with
    - **Project Manager**: ensures that the project is completed on time and on budget
    - Easier control and scheduling of phases
- Less ambiguity (if properly planned)

Cons
- Testing is not performed until the actual implementation (coding), which means that problems cannot be proactively detected and resolved ahead of time
- Customers often have changing opinions and demands (requirements)
- Competitive environments can change priorities
- High risk: no working software until late in the cycle
- Complex projects can be difficult to handle

# Where Waterfall is Suitable
Waterfall is suitable if
- Clear, fixed, and well documented requirements
- Technology is well understood
- The project is small or short in duration
- Proper resources are available to support development
- The project requires you to deliver everything at once
    - Cars
    - Computer hardware
    - etc.
