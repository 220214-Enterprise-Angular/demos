# Agile
## Background
![agile diagram](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*33LCecIS5Y0p9soE.png)

In the 1990s, a small group of thought leaders got together and developed a new philosophy called Agile.

In 2001, this group published to the web what is known as the **agile manifesto**. This is when Agile really started to be formalized as a philosophy that is now prevalent across organizations.

Agile is the process of **iterative development**. This means we pass through the SDLC multiple times (infinite number of times even).

This enables
- Feedback
- Response to change

Instead of delivering a product all at once, the product is released incrementally via each iteration.

# Agile Manifesto 4 Core Values
- **Individuals And Interactions** over processes and tools
    - Processes and tools can be important, but individuals and interactions are MORE important
- **Working Software** over comprehensive documentation
    - Documentation can be very important
    - But, ultimately having working software is more important
- **Customer Collaboration** over contract negotation
    - Financial transactions with a customer and negotiating with them is important
    - But collaborating with the customer, receiving feedback, etc. is more important
- **Responding To Change** over following a plan
    - Plans are important
    - But responding to change is more important
